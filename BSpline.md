# Simple DDA Implementation
## Overview
This C++ code provides an implementation of Simple DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer), a line drawing algorithm used in computer graphics. The implementation includes drawing a grid and a basic symmetric DDA line drawing algorithm.

## Files
SimpleDDA.h: Header file containing the declaration of the SimpleDDA class.
SimpleDDA.cpp: Source file containing the implementation of the SimpleDDA class methods.
pch.h: Precompiled header file.
Other dependencies: Ensure that you have necessary dependencies installed or included in your project.
Usage
To use the Simple DDA implementation, follow these steps:

Include the necessary headers in your project:
```
#include "pch.h"
#include "SimpleDDA.h"
```
Create an instance of the SimpleDDA class.

cpp
```
SimpleDDA simpleDDA;
```
Use the drawGrid method to generate vertices and colors for a grid. The resulting data can be used for rendering purposes.

cpp
```
vector<float> gridVertices;
vector<float> gridColors;

simpleDDA.drawGrid(gridVertices, gridColors);
```
Use the drawLineBySimpleDDA method to draw a line using the Simple DDA algorithm. Provide a Line object with start and end points.

cpp
```
Line myLine(/* specify start and end points */);
vector<float> lineVertices;

simpleDDA.drawLineBySimpleDDA(myLine, lineVertices);
```
Integrate the generated vertices and colors into your rendering pipeline as needed.

Grid Drawing
The drawGrid method generates vertices and colors for a grid. Horizontal and vertical lines are drawn within a specified grid size.

Simple DDA Line Drawing
The drawLineBySimpleDDA method implements the Simple DDA algorithm to draw a line between two points.

### Notes
Ensure that the necessary dependencies are properly configured and included in your project.
Adjust the grid size and step values in the drawGrid method based on your specific requirements.
The drawLineBySimpleDDA method is a basic implementation; additional features and optimizations can be added as needed.
